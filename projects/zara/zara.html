      <h3 class="section-title"><b>Overview</b></h3>
      <p class="project-summary">Our team explored different websites when stumbling upon the Zara website which was
        difficult to navigate through and was not accessible.
        With so many issues present, we made an attempt to redesign the website to be more accessible.
      </p>

      <h3 class="section-title"><b>Background</b></h3>
      <p class="section-text">Before we started brainstorming ideas and coming up with new designs, we had to go through
        the current Zara website and see what issues consistently appeared
        and record them to see what we might want to tackle.
      </p>
      <p class="section-text">
        Some of the major issues that we consistently came across was text being too small to read without having to
        zoom into the page, the navigation bar continuing to appear at the top
        of the page even as the user scrolls down, causing it to overlap on top of the product images, and each clothing
        section as well as clothing department having completely different layouts
        which made the shopping experience confusing due to being shown either multiple products in a grid or giant
        photos and videos of the clothing being worn by models.
      </p>
      <p class="section-text">
        The one issue that we encountered that shocked us the most was there being an accessiblity button with a
        multitude of options to help increase the text or contrast, use voice commands, and
        adjust screen readers but almost none of these options working or working in the way that it is intended.

    <section id="concept">
      <h3 class="section-title"><b>Problem Statement, Concept, and Framework</b></h3>
      <p class="section-text">Our first steps were to determine what features and options that we were going to be
        altering or incorporating in our redesign to improve the
        overall shopping experience while also maintaining the brand's image. To accomplish this, we determined to use
        Next.js as our framework as it had benefits such as
        image optimization, fast loading speeds, and internalization support which all seemed to align with what would
        be required for an e-commerce website like Zara.

    <section id="prototype">
      <h3 class="section-title"><b>Evaluations and Prototype</b></h3>
      <p class="section-text">Once we determined our framework and the design issues that we wanted to address in our
        redesign, we each began making wireframes to see which
        design elements that we liked and wanted to pursue. Each of our designs focused on making it easier for the user
        to view the product and be able to read the product name along
        with the sizes available. The layout of the website was also made to be consistent between different pages to
        ensure that users are not confused as they switch between
        different categories. We interviewed users using our wireframes and the original website to evaluate what
        designs best suited what the typical user might be expecting.
        We then took these results and created a prototype.
