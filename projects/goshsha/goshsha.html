      <h3 class="section-title"><b>Problem</b></h3>
      <p class="section-text">Our sponsor came to us with the problem of <em>Goshsha</em> not having high of a user
        retention rate and wanted to solve this issue
        through gamification.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="solution">
      <h3 class="section-title"><b>Brainstorming and Solution</b></h3>
      <p class="section-text">Our team first tackled the problem by brainstorming some ideas. Some of our initial ideas
        included implementing a virtual pet or an AI
        fashion assistant. We consulted with our sponsor about these ideas before coming to a main idea of combining the
        two to having a virtual assistant that can help
        with finding a user's shade as well as similar prooducts.

    <section id="implement">
      <h3 class="section-title"><b>Implementation</b></h3>
      <p class="section-text">As <em>Goshsha</em> is currrently only an iOS app, we had to work in Xcode and Swift to
        implement our code. As we moved forward with implementing
        our features, we had made mockups in Figma and presented these to our sponsor to get their feedback and
        approval. Once this was achieved, we had those in charge of coding
        start working on making a working prototype of that while the rest of the team started working on making more
        refined mockups of aspects that we got feedback on or need to expand
        more on. </p>
