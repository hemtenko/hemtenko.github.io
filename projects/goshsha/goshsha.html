      <h3 class="section-title"><b>Overview</b></h3>
       <p class="project-summary"><em>Goshsha</em> is a mobile shopping app to help find information about products through scanning or snapping photos of the product, making it like "<em>Shazam</em> for shopping". As our senior capstone project at UC Irvine, our team worked along with our sponsor to improve the app's user experience to gain more engagement and solve a common issue experienced in the beauty industry through new features.

    <section id="problem">
      <h3 class="section-title"><b>Problem</b></h3>
      <p class="section-text">Our sponsor came to us with the problem of <em>Goshsha</em> not having high of a user retention rate and wanted to solve this issue through gamification.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="solution">
      <h3 class="section-title"><b>Brainstorming and Solution</b></h3>
      <p class="section-text">Our team first tackled the problem by brainstorming some ideas. Some of our initial ideas included implementing a virtual pet or an AI fashion assistant. We consulted with our sponsor about these ideas before coming to a main idea of combining the two to having a virtual assistant that can help with finding a user's shade as well as similar products. The slides for our inital ideas can be found

    <section id="implement">
      <h3 class="section-title"><b>Implementation</b></h3>
      <p class="section-text">As <em>Goshsha</em> is currrently only an iOS app, we had to work in Xcode and Swift to implement our code. As we moved forward with implementing our features, we had made mockups in Figma and presented these to our sponsor to get their feedback and approval. Once this was achieved, we had those in charge of coding start working on making a working prototype of that while the rest of the team started working on making more refined mockups of aspects that we got feedback on or need to expand more on. </p>
