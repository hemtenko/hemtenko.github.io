      <h3 class="section-title"><b>Surveying</b></h3>
      <p class="section-text">An online survey was created and distributed to our target population, college students that receive financial aid, to obtain information that would help determine what concerns were present and needed to be addressed. This helped up to determine what features were important for us to focus on and develop. This also allowed for our group to see the general trends and options that emergred from our target population. Our analysis of the survey can be found

      <p class="section-text">After the analysis of the survey answers was done, our team began to create sketches,
        wireframes, and an overall mockup to visualize what the final application might look like as well as what the
        different sections or pages of the applications might have based on the features that we chose that would
        address the concerns that our target population has mentioned. Click
